Class
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a structure that allows you to group together 
a set of properties (called attributes) and functions (called methods) to manipulate those properties

Take the following class that defines a person with the name and age properties and the greet() method.

class Person:

      def __init__(self, name, age): # class constructor
          self.name = name # class variable
          self.age = age # class variable

      def greet(self): # class function to print a greeting
          print("Hello, my name is %s!" % self.name)
